1. make sure that the server code accept port number from process.env.PORT.
2. add engines :{ node: 'version number', npm: 'version-number'} to package.json so that Heroku knows which node env

3. specify a start script to let Heroku knows how to start the server.
4. create an .gitignore file to avoid committing installed dependencies
5. create Heroku account and install it.
6. Heroku login and use cred and then Heroku create to create a new project

8. Push code to this new remote
